Restructuring data and defining new default criteria

- To effectively predict client defaults, we must first restructure the available data and establish new default criteria. This involves:

    1. Data Restructuring: Cleanse and organize the data to ensure consistency and accuracy. This may involve handling missing values, removing outliers, and standardizing data formats.

    2. New Default Criteria: Define new parameters and thresholds for identifying potential defaulters. This may involve considering factors such as credit history, payment patterns, and financial indicators.

- Building Predictive Models for Default Prediction

Once the data is restructured and new default criteria are defined, we can build predictive models to identify clients at risk of default. This involves selecting relevant features, training the model on historical data, and evaluating its performance.

The predictive models will allow us to proactively identify clients at risk of default, enabling timely interventions and risk mitigation strategies.
